This is a trimmed list from the original repo. Keeping here until I can evaluate and rehome the tasks to take on.

## TODO List

[ ] dbup init -> display information about successful file creation
[ ] dbup status -x -n -> remove redundant empty line
[ ] subFolders: yes -> Displays strange scripts' names: e.g. subfolder.005.sql

## Considerations

[ ] Publish the extension to the marketplace
[ ] Drop database for PostgreSQL and MySQL
[ ] Backup a database
[ ] Automatic backup a database before upgrade
[ ] Support of Sqlite
