## Improved testing

*[ ] integration tests, assert a table is or is not created, not just the journal entry. 
  *[ ] reenable MySql timeout test to see if table is not created on timeout but journal is updated
*[ ] structured logging for better debugging and monitoring in deployed environments

This is a trimmed list from the original repo. Keeping here until I can evaluate and rehome the tasks to take on.

## TODO List

*[ ] dbup init -> display information about successful file creation
*[ ] dbup status -x -n -> remove redundant empty line
*[ ] subFolders: yes -> Displays strange scripts' names: e.g. subfolder.005.sql

## Considerations

*[ ] Publish the extension to the marketplace
*[ ] Drop database for PostgreSQL and MySQL
*[ ] Backup a database
*[ ] Automatic backup a database before upgrade
*[ ] Support of Sqlite
